# User Dashboard

A simple responsive dashboard build using **React**, **TypeScript** and **SCSS**. The dashboard fetches a list of users from a REST API, allows sorting by name(-ish) and email and a search functionality.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies: npm install

3. Start the development server: npm run dev

## TODO

1. Fix the sorting function for names. Split and look for eventual titles that are in the list.
2. Add tests like API data fetching, search and sorting functionality.

## Time spent: approx 1h 45 min including setup etc.
